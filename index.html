	<h1>Welcome. I am Michael Lengefeld.</h1>
	<p>I am a PhD Candidate in the Sociology Department at Washington State University
		in the beautiful Palouse region of Eastern Washington. Broadly speaking, my

		the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia - and the environmental and 
		social implications of these pursuits. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
