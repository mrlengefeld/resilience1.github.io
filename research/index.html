	<li><font size="6">Methods<br></font><br><p> This course is designed to provide stduents with a basic understanding of research methods.
            We emphasize issues such as the logic of research design, issues of conceptualization and measurement, the range
            of data collection methods available to scientists, and social scientists in particular, and what scientists do
            with the data once they have collected it.</li></p><br>
	
<li><font size="6">Sociology of Film<br></font><br><p> The Sociology of Film examines the content of films and how this content is 
              shaped by the structure of the film industry. In short, it seeks to understand the influence of “Hollywood”
              on the content of “Hollywood” films. In so doing, it examines the inevitable tension between art and economics
              within the film industry.  This course covers a series of topics related to the film production and film content.
              It examines the types of stories that films tell and the way those stories are told using various film techniques.
              It also examines the structure the film industry and how it influences the content of films. Finally, it examines 
              the division of creative labor within the film industry and how creative artists influence the content of 
              these same films. In the final analysis, this course seeks to understand how films can be both a commodity 
              and an art.</li><p>
