DISSERTATION

“Nuclear Warmaking and the Treadmill of Destruction Mechanism: Exterminism and Environmental Inequality in the United States and the Soviet Union.” A study of the path-dependent socio-environmental dynamics generated by the first Cold War and the implications of this inertia during the new Cold War. Fine-grained comparative historical analyses of the nuclear warmaking of two societies - the Soviet Union and the United States- yields to causal mechanistic explanations of these environmental dynamics.
